Hello, I'm Zach. I'm a backend-focused software developer. I recently graduated from NuCamp's backend developer bootcamp and am currently learning Django and intermediate Azure services. I'm also in the process of obtaining Azure fundamentals and Associate certifications (Developer Associate AZ-204).

I come from a non-technical background where I spent most of my time in college studying for a career in federal law enforcement. However, after taking a class in MATLAB and another in Machine Learning with MATLAB late in my education, I discovered my passion for computer science and programming. Upon graduating, I decided to make a career shift into development and have never looked back.

## Interests
I’m interested in collaborating/contribtuting to anything related to backend/or cloud development.

Outside of development, I spend most of my time with my two-year-old son and Wife, who is incredibly supportive of my endeavor to break into a junior developer role.
I'm also an active member of DAV (Disabled American Veterans) and participate in helping both transitioning and returning veterans who have rightfully earned benefits in any capacity that I can.
