Hello, I'm Zach. I'm a backend-focused software developer. I recently graduated from NuCamp's backend developer bootcamp and am currently learning Django and intermediate Azure development. I'm also in the process of obtaining Azure fundamentals and Associate certifications (Developer Associate AZ-204).
I come from a non-technical background where I spent my time in college training and studying for a career at federal law enforcement agency. I discovered programming and my passion for it late in my education. Upon graduating I deciced to make a massive career shift into development and never looked back.

Outside of development I spend most of my time with my wife and two year old son who are greatly supportive in my endeavor to break into a junior developer role.
I'm also an active member of DAV (Disabled American Veterans) and participate with helping both transitioning and returning veterans who have rightfuly earned their benefits in any capacity that I can.

## Interests
I’m interested in collaborating/contribtuting to anything related to backend/or cloud development.
