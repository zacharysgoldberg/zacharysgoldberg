Hello, I'm a backend-focused software developer. I recently graduated from NuCamp's backend developer bootcamp and am currently learning FastAPI and cloud services.

I come from a non-technical background where I spent most of my time in college studying for a career in federal law enforcement. However, after taking a class in MATLAB and another in Machine Learning with MATLAB late in my education, I discovered my passion for programming  and computer science. Upon graduating, I decided to make a career shift into development.

## Interests
I’m interested in collaborating/contribtuting to anything backend/or cloud related.

Outside of development, I spend most of my time with my two-year-old son and Wife.
I'm also an active member of the DAV (Disabled American Veterans) association.

## Current Projects

[Exercise-Map](https://github.com/zacharysgoldberg/Exercise-Map): Frontend complete, Backend in-progress -> 75% complete
